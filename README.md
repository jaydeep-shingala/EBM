Implementation of Energy Based Generative Models for MNIST dataset and also paper review of improved contrastive divergence training of EBMs.

Here, is the given implementation of the Energy based generative models for MNIST images dataset. MCMC sampling is used for sampling images from distribution.

The more detailed review of the paper: Improved Contrastive Divergence Training of Energy Based Models [https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.01316v4.pdf] is given as FinalReport*.pdf file.
